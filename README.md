A/B Testing: Website Redesign
=============================

This project provides an analysis of an A/B test performed on a website redesign for a Datacamp Competition. 
Python pandas, scipy and statsmodels packages are used to perform a hypothesis test on conversion statistics

Analysis
------------

The analysis includes 2 main parts. 

*   **Statistical analysis**: The script performs several statistical tests to compare the performance of the old and new versions of the website. These tests include the t-test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the chi-squared test.
    
*   **Effect size calculation**: The script also calculates effect sizes for the statistical tests. This can be used to quantify the magnitude of the differences between the old and new versions of the website.
